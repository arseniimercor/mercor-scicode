  "problem_description_main": "We consider an array of N identical nanospheres along the x-axis, each trapped by a linearly polarized optical tweezer. The spheres interact via optical binding forces due to their induced dipole moments. For small oscillations around equilibrium, the system can be approximated as a set of coupled harmonic oscillators. Our goal is to:\n1. Compute the optical binding force between two trapped nanospheres using the Rayleigh approximation.\n2. Construct the effective Hamiltonian for the linearized motion of N nanospheres, capturing both the trapping and inter-particle coupling.\n3. Solve the time evolution of the phonon occupation numbers (average number of quanta of vibrational excitation) by integrating the Lindblad master equation using a fourth-order Runge-Kutta method.",
  "problem_background_main": "Background:\n\nIn the Rayleigh regime, a nanosphere trapped by a laser beam can be approximated as a point dipole with polarizability:\n\n\\[ \\alpha = 4 \\pi \\varepsilon_0 a^3 \\frac{n^2 - 1}{n^2 + 2}, \\]\n\nwhere \( a \) is the sphere radius, \( n \) its refractive index, and \( \\varepsilon_0 \) is the vacuum permittivity.\n\nFor a given trap power \( P \), the electric field amplitude is approximately:\n\n\\[ E = \\sqrt{\\frac{4P}{\\pi w^2 \\varepsilon_0 c}}, \\]\n\nwhere \( w \) is the beam waist and \( c \) the speed of light.\n\nWhen two nanospheres are placed at a distance \( R \) along the x-axis, their induced dipoles interact. This results in an optical binding force along x. In a linearly polarized field with polarization angle \( \\varphi \) relative to the x-axis, the force can be derived from the dipole-dipole interaction.\n\nFor small displacements around equilibrium, the optical binding force can be linearized, reducing the system to coupled harmonic oscillators. The Hamiltonian of this system can be written in terms of phonon operators \( b_i \) for each oscillator, leading to a matrix form with on-site frequencies and couplings. Including damping and thermal noise leads to a Lindblad master equation for the correlation matrix \( C_{ij} = \\langle b_i^\dagger b_j \\rangle \). Numerically integrating this equation using RK4 allows us to track the time evolution of the phonon occupation numbers.\n",
